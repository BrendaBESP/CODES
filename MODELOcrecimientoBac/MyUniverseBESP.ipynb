Típicamente dura 5-6 años, principalmente por razones de capital y desarrollo del mercado. En el caso actual, se ahorraron esos 5-6 años al invertir billones de dólares en esa capacidad sin esperar a saber si la vacuna funcionaba. Eso es vital, pues lo \"rápido\" de la vacuna no tiene que ver con saltar pasos en cuanto a la vacuna propiamente, sino invertir dinero para producirla.\n","Típicamente se prueba primero la vacuna y entonces comienzan los 5-6 años de desarrollo industrial. Aquí se hizo ese desarrollo en 5-6 meses, simplemente porque se invirtieron 10 billones de dólares de antemano.\n","- Habrá un sistema casi \"real-time\" para identificar efectos secundarios y medir duración de la protección. \n","- Las vacunas de Moderna y Pfizer requieren DOS dosis (21 días de espera en Pfizer, 28 días para Moderna); mandarán emails y textos para recordarle a las personas cuándo les toca la #2. \n","- Otra razón para la velocidad de las vacunas fue la respuesta de la gente para ser voluntaria en los trials. Típicamente se piden 3,000 placebo y 3,000 con vacuna y tarda años en reclutar. Aquí se hizo en semanas y lograron 22,000 y 22,000. Es decir, el universo de los ensayos es casi 7 veces más grande de lo normal, lo que permite mayor análisis de datos.\n","- 95% de todos los efectos secundarios identificados en la historia de las vacunas ocurren a las 6 semanas desde la última dosis. La vacuna de Pfizer esperó 8 semanas y contando; mantendrán monitoreando por 2 años.\n","- Vacuna de Pfizer usa tecnología mRNA, que no es otra cosa que una instrucción que se le da a las células para que produzcan su propia versión de las \"puyitas\" del coronavirus, puyitas (proteínas) que permiten al virus infectar a las células humanas. La vacuna hace que uno mismo produzca sus propias \"puyitas\" (sin el virus, claro está) y el sistema inmunológico reacciona a ellas como si fueran en virus de verdad. La vacuna no interactúa con el núcleo de las células ni afecta el código genético. Las vacunas mRNA tienen la ventaja adicional de que: 1. no tienen producto viral y 2. permite vacunaciones posteriores para \"boostear\" el sistema inmunológico.\n","- No se incluyó en los estudios a menores de 16, mujeres embarazadas o lactando y a inmunocomprometidos. Posiblemente no recomienden su uso, Por ahora, es para estos grupos en los que se estudia más.\n","- El % de personas que dicen que no se van a poner la vacuna varía por nivel de educación e ideología. Las personas ultra-derechistas y que no se graduaron de high school son el sector más resistente a ponérsela, las personas liberales y con educación universitaria son las más receptivas. Mientras más educación, más sube el % de aceptación.\n","-Comorbidades más vulnerables: obesidad, falla renal, diabetes. . \n","- La reacción inmunológica de la vacuna puede ser hasta 4 veces más poderosa que infección natural. \n","-No hubo efectos secundarios serios, excepto fiebre, dolor muscular, que solo duraba unas horas y se entiende que significa que el sistema inmunológico estaba reaccionando positivamente a la vacuna. \n","- 95% eficacia; de 170 personas que se enfermaron con COVID-19, 162 eran del grupo placebo y 8 personas tenían vacuna. De esas 8, 7 fueron asintomáticas. Solo 1 fue moderada, pero no fue hospitalizado. Es decir, protegió 100% contra muerte, intubación, ingreso a ICU e incluso hospitalización; matemáticamente, hay un 97.5% de probabilidad de que, en general, la vacuna sea 90% o más en cuanto a efectividad. \n","- Solamente 4 personas de 22,000 (0.02%), sufrieron de parálisis muscular facial parcial temporal (Bell's Palsy) y recuperaron sin problema. \n","- En cuanto a las reacciones alérgicas, están evaluando, pero parece que se trata de reacciones alérgicas típicas a cualquier vacuna y no a esta vacuna en particular.\n","- La votación final a favor de la vacuna fue 17-4 (1 abstención).\n","Los 4 se opusieron SOLAMENTE porque entendían que debía ser de 18 en adelante y no de 16 años en adelante. En cuanto a 18+, fue unánime."]}]}
